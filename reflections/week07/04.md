![replace_me](https://codeworks.blob.core.windows.net/public/assets/img/illustrations/placeholder.svg)

## Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?

I definitely tried to work on good naming conventions so I always knew what I was doing and where I was.

2. What went well this week?

I think I finally am starting to find a good work flow for myself when coding.

3. What would you do differently?

I would probably time block a bit more and be more aware of how long I'm working on specific things.
