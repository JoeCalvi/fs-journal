> **ðŸ“– [The Observer Pattern](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk3/04-Observer-Pattern)**

## Questions

1. What problems does the Observer Pattern seek to solve?

The observer design pattern solves the problem of keeping a bunch of elements synced with the same data.

2. What are the three mechanisms of the observer pattern?

The three mechanisms in the observer pattern are subscribe, unsubscribe, and broadcast. Subscribe adds new observable events; unsubscribe removes observable events; and broadcast executes all events with bound data.

3. Review the code generated from the bcw-template and reflect on the proxy objects from yesterday, and your understanding of the observer pattern today. With this knowledge, explain how the magic of the bcw-template uses these two concepts to manage and update the dom.

With the observer pattern, managing the DOM is much cleaner and able to be done with more reusable bits of code.
