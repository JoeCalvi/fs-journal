## Questions

1. What are the three states of a `Promise`?

pending, resolved, and rejected

2. How do `promise`s seek to resolve the issues of "callback hell"?

using promises allows you to attach callbacks rather than pass them, allowing for much cleaner code.

3. What is the difference between `.then()` and `.catch()`?

.then() is used for when a promise is resolved, and .catch() is used for when a promise is rejected.
