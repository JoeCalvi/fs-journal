## Questions

"Hoisting" is a JavaScript mechanism where variables and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope before execution.

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

Var you may use for global variables that may be used throughout the app, while const and let may be more useful in specific functions or blocks.
