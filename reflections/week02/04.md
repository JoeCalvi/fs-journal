## Questions

1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?

It's a basic outline of general logic that allows you to tackle one thing at a time and test your code in bits.

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?

I usually consult the docs and try a handful of different methods and console.log() along the way.

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?

One block of code should never go beyond 80 lines, and if it does, then it should probably be broken down into different functions. Shorter code is better code.
