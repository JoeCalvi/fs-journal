## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 

- Wire-framing can save you a lot of trial and error time by giving you a good idea of what you want your site to look like without actually having to do any code for it.

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

- You can be as detailed as you want to be in wire-frames, but generally less detail is okay because the wire-frame is just a general map of where you want to eventually go.

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

- I think they're worth it mostly in the scenario where you're working with a client and need to get a good idea of what they actually want before you put in all the effort to code the site.
