## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use

- A pseudo-class is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a different result under specific conditions. Some more common pseudo-classes seem to be "hover" and "required"/"optional".

2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?

- Specificity is used in CSS to assign certain attributes or effects to specific elements in the HTML.

3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?

- I feel like over-utilizing !important would lead to a lot of confusion overall when building a project.
