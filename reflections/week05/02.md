> **ðŸ“– [MongoDb Relationships](https://codeworksacademy.com/fs-student-guide/resources/wk5/02-Relationships)**

## Questions

1. What are the three types of relationships?

one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many

2. What are the benefits of the traditional `linking` of relationships instead of `Embedding`

linking can prevent the document size from growing too large, making pagenation easier

3. What are some of the challenges faced when deciding how to manage a many-to-many relationship that ultimately drive your decision on how to create it?

you have to create more models that end up mirroring each others' data, so ultimately you're just going to end up dealing with a lot more data and therefore have to create more functionality between multiple sets.
