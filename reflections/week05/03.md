two minute rule for sure, to always resond to emails. practice and adapt, and hopefully get better at it every time. and the golden hour in order to increase my own productivity.

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 

probably would have benefitted from timeboxing on my cookie clicker project to be honest. i got hung up on a few things for much longer than i should have and because of that didn't quite get to do everything i wanted.
