# Application Architecture, MVC Design Pattern

**1.** What are the Pillars of Object Oriented Programming (`OOP`)?

inheritence, polymorphism, and encapsulation & abstraction
```
**2.** How would you access the `name` of the below object using the `property` variable?

property = staff.name
```
**3.** What is Encapsulation?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Encapsulation brings together data and the methods which operate on data in a single unit, which allows the user to control access to the unit.
```
**4.** What does the S stand for in the `SOLID` principles?

single responsibility

**5.** What the difference between a `class` and an instance of a `class`?

A class is a type of bluepring you can use to make objects while an 'instane' refers to the object's relationship to its class.

**6.** What is a `Proxy` object?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->

Proxy objects are created to be used in place of original objects, which may redefine fundamental object operations like getting, setting, and defining properties.
```

**7.** What is the purpose of the `MVC` pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The MVC pattern is designed to limit the user's access to the data we encode in the app and create a layer of security and privacy.
```
**8.** What is the job of the `Controller` in the `MVC` Pattern?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The controller's job is to take the actions of the user and perform tasks based on our code.
```

**9.** What is the job of the `Service` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
```
The service is the layer that handles all of the data manipulation.
```
**10.** What is the job of the `Model` in `MVC`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
